        <h2>Top Science Careers to Look For in 2022</h2>
        <p>
          Science is a multi-disciplined field with a significant potential for
          progress. It offers a dynamic work<br />
          atmosphere and an extensive learning and exploration area. Let’s
          explore various careers in science now.
        </p>
        <h2>1.Physicist</h2>
        <p>
          Physics researchers look into the qualities of matter, energy, and
          time. A few physicists usually<br />
          conduct further theoretical research to find out more about how the
          universe actually works. In<br />
          contrast, others run applied research to apply theoretical knowledge
          to actual processes or devices to improve<br />
          the technology we use.
